# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

## Introduction

## Guidlines

### Principles of Prompting
1. Write clear and specific instructions  
  clear =! short  
2. Give the model time to think  
  prompt injection  

#### Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions

Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input  	
Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output  
	HTML, JSON  
Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied  
	Check assumptions required to do that task  
Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting  
	Give successful examples of completing task. then ask model to perform the task	

#### Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task
Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

### Model Limitations
